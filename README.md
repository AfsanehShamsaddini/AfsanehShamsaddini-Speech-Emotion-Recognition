# Speech Emotion Recognition

This repository contains a Python implementation for recognizing emotions from speech audio files using a fine-tuned Wav2Vec 2.0 model. The model has achieved an impressive accuracy of **99.6%** on the test dataset.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you will need Python 3.x and some additional libraries. Follow the instructions below to set up the environment and start using the code.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `librosa`
- `torchaudio`
- `torch`
- `transformers`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `sklearn`
  
You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas librosa torchaudio torch transformers matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/speech-emotion-recognition.git
   cd speech-emotion-recognition
   ```

2. Install the required packages as mentioned in the prerequisites.

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset of audio files in a suitable directory structure. The code expects audio files to be named with labels indicating the emotion (e.g., `filename_fear.wav`).

2. Modify the dataset path in the code to point to your audio files.

3. Run the script to train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

4. To predict the emotion of a new audio file, use the `predict_emotion` function in the script. Provide the path to the audio file, and it will return the predicted emotion label.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the TESS (Toronto Emotional Speech Set) dataset, which contains recordings of actors speaking various sentences with different emotions.

## Model Training

The model is trained using the Wav2Vec2 architecture from Hugging Face's Transformers library. The training process involves:

- Loading audio data and corresponding labels.
- Preprocessing the audio data.
- Fine-tuning the Wav2Vec2 model on the training dataset.
- Evaluating the model on a test dataset.

## Results

After training, the model achieved an accuracy of **99.6%** on the test dataset. The results are printed to the console during evaluation.
