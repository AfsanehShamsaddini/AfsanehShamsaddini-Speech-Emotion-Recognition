## Model Training

The model is trained using the Wav2Vec2 architecture from Hugging Face's Transformers library. The training process involves:

- Loading audio data and corresponding labels.
- Preprocessing the audio data.
- Fine-tuning the Wav2Vec2 model on the training dataset.
- Evaluating the model on a test dataset.

## Results

After training, the model achieved an accuracy of **99.6%** on the test dataset. The results are printed to the console during evaluation.
